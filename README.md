## Dependencies

### Runtimes
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.9+

### Browsers
- Google Chrome _(`npx playwright install --force chrome` may be used)_.

### Python dependencies
- ‚ö†Ô∏è For now: Python dependencies are installed at machine level, as a post-install step of `npm install`.

### Known Ubuntu packages

curl bash gcc g++ python3 python3-pip python3-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev libjpeg-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev ghostscript poppler-utils
```

- ‚ö†Ô∏è On Linux, this project is only compatible with Ubuntu at the time, because it uses Playwright + Chrome.
- Node may be sourced from [Nodesource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#installation-instructions).

### For development on Mac OS
A `brewfile` is available. Run `brew bundle` to install machine-level dependencies that can be provided by [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
